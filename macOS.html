            <p>macOS is an operating system designed by Apple. The operating system is what allows you to use a computer. macOS comes preloaded on all new Apple Macintosh computers (commonly known as Macs).

                macOS makes it possible to complete all kinds of everyday tasks on your computer. For example, you can use it to browse the Internet, check your email, edit digital photos, listen to music, and play games.<br>macOS is a proprietary graphical operating system developed and marketed by Apple Inc. since 2001. It is the primary operating system for Apple's Mac computers. Within the market of desktop and laptop computers it is the second most widely used desktop OS, after Microsoft Windows and ahead of Chrome OS.<br>
                Earlier versions of macOS have been around since the mid-1980s. There have been many versions since then, but the most recent ones include macOS Mojave (2018), High Sierra (2017), Sierra (2016). El Capitan (2015), and Yosemite (2014).

                In some older versions, macOS was called OS X (pronounced O-S ten). However, many people use the terms OS X and macOS interchangeably because the basic functionality of the operating system is still very similar.</p>

            <p>The Apple M1 is an ARM-based system on a chip (SoC) designed by Apple Inc. as a central processing unit (CPU) and graphics processing unit (GPU) for its Macintosh computers and iPad Pro tablets.<br>Apple in November 2020 released the first Macs with an Arm-based M1 chip, debuting new 2020 13-inch MacBook Pro, MacBook Air, and Mac mini models. In 2021, Apple added the M1 iMac and the M1 iPad Pro. The M1 chip has received rave reviews for its incredible performance and efficiency, and it is the culmination of more than a decade of Apple's work on chips created for the iPhone and the iPad.<br>

                One of the coolest new features of the M1 chip is that, because it uses the same processor architecture as the iPhone and iPad, it can now run apps designed for those devices natively.<br>The memory architecture makes the RAM not user-upgradeable; it is sold with 8 GB or 16 GB, which is shared among all compute units.

                The initial versions contain an architectural defect permitting sandboxed applications to exchange data, violating the security model.</p>

            <p>The M1 chip brings up to 3.5x faster CPU performance, up to 6x faster GPU performance, and up to 15x faster machine learning capabilities compared to the Intel chips used in prior-generation machines.

                Compared to the latest PC laptop chips, the M1 offers 2x faster CPU performance and does so using just 25 percent of the power.<br>
                Even with the incredible speed improvements that the M1 chip brings, it is also more battery-efficient than any other Mac chip Apple has released to date.

                Battery life in an M1 Mac lasts up to 2x longer than in prior-generation Macs. The Mac with the longest battery life is the 13-inch MacBook Pro, which lasts for up to 20 hours. That's double the battery life of the prior-generation mode.<br>The energy efficiency of the M1 doubles the battery life of M1-based MacBooks from the previous Intel-based MacBooks.<br></p>

                <ol>
                    <li><h2>CPU</h2>
                        <p>The M1 chip includes an 8-core CPU with four high-performance cores and four high-efficiency cores. The high-performance cores are designed to offer the best performance for power-intensive single-threaded tasks.<br>
                            This combination allows power-use optimizations not possible with previous Apple–Intel architecture devices. Apple claims the energy-efficient cores use one-tenth the power of the high-performance ones.<br>

                            The four high-performance cores can work together to offer impressive multithreaded performance that has allowed the M1 Macs to outshine even the highest-end 16-inch MacBook Pro models.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li><h2>GPU</h2>
                        <p>The M1 integrates an Apple designed eight-core (seven in some base models) graphics processing unit (GPU). Each GPU core is split into 16 Execution Units, which each contain eight Arithmetic Logic Units (ALUs).<br>
                            The ‌Apple Silicon‌ chip has an 8-core GPU, but there's also a version used in the entry-level ‌MacBook Air‌ models that has one of the cores disabled for a 7-core GPU.<br>Graphics performance tests have suggested the M1 chip offers performance that exceeds the GeForce GTX 1050 Ti and Radeon RX 560. It also earned an OpenCL score of 19305, similar to the Radeon RX 560X and Radeon Pro WX 4100.</p>
                        
                    </li>
                    <li><h2>Neural Engine</h2>
                       <p>The M1 chip has a built-in Neural Engine, a component that Apple first started adding to its A-series chips a few years ago. The Neural Engine is designed to accelerate machine learning tasks across the Mac for things like video analysis, voice recognition, image processing, and more.

                        The 16-core Neural Engine is capable of 11 trillion operations per second for up to 15x faster machine learning performance compared to the previous generation of models that have moved to the M1.

            <p>The Mac transition to Intel processors was the process of changing the central processing unit (CPU) of Apple Inc.'s line of Mac computers, as well as its server offerings at the time, from PowerPC to Intel x86 processors.
                <br>The change was announced at the 2005 Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) by then-Apple CEO Steve Jobs, who said Apple would gradually stop using PowerPC microprocessors supplied by Freescale (formerly Motorola) and IBM.<br>

                This was the second time Apple changed the processor instruction set architecture of its personal computers. The first was in 1994, when Apple discarded the Mac's original Motorola 68000 series architecture in favor of the then-new PowerPC platform.</p>

                Apple incorporated several features in the design of the MacBook Air, such as the reduction of lead to make it more environmentally friendly. The MacBook Air contains no BFRs and PVC wiring, meets Energy Star 5.0 requirements, has a recyclable enclosure, and is rated EPEAT Gold. Its display is made with arsenic-free glass and contains no mercury.<br>
                Although MacBook Air components are officially non-user-replaceable, third parties do sell upgrade kits for the SSDs. The flash memory and battery are enclosed in the casing, and the RAM is soldered onto the motherboard. The flash memory is difficult to access and has a 128 MB cache[44] and a mSATA connection (updated to a proprietary PCIe interface) to the motherboard.
                <br>The third generation MacBook Air follows the design of the previous generation with a tapered aluminum enclosure, but takes some design elements from the Retina MacBook and MacBook Pro, such as a flush display with black bezels and a glossy opaque Apple logo on the rear, and an edge-to-edge trackpad.</p>

            <p>The Intel processors that Apple has used in its Macs since 2006 are x86 chips. The processors Apple makes in house are based on ARM, but include a number of Apple technologies (so they aren't ARM chips, strictly speaking).<br>
                When we tested them we found Apple's M1 chips to delivered performance that was equal to, or even better, than the most powerful Intel laptop chips - and the M1 Macs aren't even targetted at those who need the most powerful laptops. The M1 really is better than a comparable Intel chip - just as Apple claimed it is.<br>
                To be blunt, it's a scary time for Intel. Apple's ARM-based M1 chip has been a massive success. We assumed Apple's CPUs would be competitive, but few would have guessed that they'd skip the awkward first-gen stage and immediately make the MacBook Pro and MacBook Air far more powerful than their Intel-equipped counterparts. Apple is also bringing the M1 chip to its new iMac. </p>

                        <li>
                            <h2>Performance</h2>
                            <p>The two high-end 13-inch MacBook Pro models continue to use 10th-generation Intel Core chips: Both standard configurations use a 2.0GHz quad-core processor, which can be customized to a 2.3GHz quad-core Core i7 processor. Both Intel models feature Intel Iris Plus graphics.<br>

                                Meanwhile, the 13-inch ‌M1‌ MacBook Pro is one of the first Macs to be updated with an Apple-designed Arm-based chip rather than an Intel chip like prior MacBook Pro models. The ‌M1‌ is Apple's first System on a Chip designed for the Mac, which means it has the processor, GPU, I/O, security features, and RAM all on one chip. By comparison, these components in the high-end Intel MacBook Pro are segregated on the logic board, which gives the ‌M1‌ chip a number of performance advantages.<br>
                                The ‌M1‌ also features an 8-core CPU and an integrated 8-core GPU. The CPU has four high-efficiency cores and four high-performance cores. When doing simple tasks like browsing the web or reading email the MacBook Pro engages the high-efficiency cores to preserve battery life, but for more system-intensive tasks like photo and video editing, the high-performance cores are used. Compared to the high-performance cores, the high-efficiency cores use a tenth of the power while still delivering the performance that Mac users need for everyday tasks.

                        <li>
                            <h2>Software Compatibility</h2>
                            <p>Apps designed for the ‌iPhone‌ and the ‌iPad‌ will run on Apple silicon natively, so you'll be able to use a lot of your favorite iOS apps on the ‌M1‌ MacBook Pro desktop, albeit with varying degrees of control compatibility. This will depend on the extent to which third-party developers work to furnish Mac input controls like keyboard and mouse in their iOS apps, but the going assumption is that most future Catalyst apps will accommodate both touch and Mac input.<br>

                                None of the above goes for the Intel MacBook Pro, which only runs x86-64 code for Intel's architecture. The same can't be said for the ‌M1‌ MacBook Pro, which can run both iOS and x86-64 software, thanks to Apple's Rosetta 2 translation layer. In some cases, apps built with x86-64 actually run faster in Rosetta 2 than they do on Intel Macs.
                                
                                </p>

                        <li>
                            <h2>Battery Life</h2>
                            <p>The ‌M1‌ MacBook Pro is advertised as having twice the battery life as the Intel model. (Yes, you read that right.) Apple breaks it down like this: The Intel machine offers up to 10 hours of web browsing or up to 10 hours of Apple TV movie playback, while the Apple silicon machine offers up to 17 hours of web browsing or up to 20 hours of ‌Apple TV‌ movie playback.<br>
                                Thanks to the ‌M1‌ chip's phenomenal computational efficiency, Apple has managed to eke out twice as much usage on a single charge from what is basically the same 58-watt-hour lithium-polymer battery.

                            </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <h2>Design</h2>
                            <p>The 13-inch ‌M1‌ MacBook Pro replaces Apple's entry-level Intel MacBook Pro and is virtually identical in all but the innards. That means the ‌M1‌ MacBook Pro and the high-end Intel MacBook Pro that Apple still sells both share the same uniform, slab-like design, Magic Keyboard, and Touch Bar with ‌Touch ID‌.<br>

                                Otherwise, the only thing that externally differentiates the two models is the number of Thunderbolt 3 ports (more on that later). There's also a negligible weight difference between the two models: 3.0 pounds (1.4kg) for the ‌M1‌ vs 3.1 pounds (1.4kg) for the Intel, so whichever model you go for, both are very similar in terms of portability.
                                
                                </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <h2>Microphones and Speakers</h2>
                            <p>Both ‌M1‌ and Intel 13-inch machines feature the same stereo speakers with high dynamic range, wide stereo sound, and support for Dolby Atmos playback. However, whereas the Intel model has a three-mic array with directional beamforming, Apple describes the mic array in the ‌M1‌ model as "studio-quality" with a high signal-to-noise ratio, which could tip the balance for you if you make a lot of video calls.</p>
