    <h2>
    A central processing unit (CPU), also called a central processor, 
    main processor or just processor, is the electronic circuitry that executes instructions comprising a computer program. <br>The CPU performs basic arithmetic, logic, controlling, and input/output (I/O) operations specified by the instructions in the program.<br> This contrasts with external components such as main memory and I/O circuitry, and specialized processors such as graphics processing units (GPUs).
